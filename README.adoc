= syncup(1)

== Name

syncup - synchronise a local maildir store with a remote

== Synopsis

*syncup* [*-C* _file_] [*-H* _path_] [*-c* _file_] [*-hv*] _maildir-root_

== Description

Use **mbsync**(1) to synchronise a local maildir collection at _maildir-root_
with a remote, run **notmuch-new**(1) on the synchronised local store, and run
pre- and post-sync hooks as appropriate.

=== Options

*-C* _file_::
	Use _file_ as the configuration file for **notmuch**(1).

*-H* _path_::
	Search for hooks in the directory given by _path_. A relative _path_ is
	interpreted relative to _maildir-root_.
	 +
	Default: _none_

*-c* _file_::
	Use _file_ as the configuration file for **mbsync**(1).

*-h*::
	Display a summary of *syncup* and its options, then exit.

*-v*::
	Enable verbose output from *syncup*, **mbsync**(1), and **notmuch-new**(1).
	The environment variable *SYNCUP_VERBOSE* is exported for hooks to also
	optionally produce verbose output.

=== Hooks

A '`hook`' is an executable that is called either before or after **mbsync**(1)
and **notmuch-new**(1) are called. All hooks are executed in the root of the
Maildir directory hierarchy with no arguments. Successful hooks are expected to
have exit status 0. Hooks with non-zero exit status will cause *syncup* to
immediately abort.

Note that hooks which need to execute **notmuch**(1) _should_ be executed by
**notmuch-new**(1). We export the **NOTMUCH_CONFIG** environment variable so
these hooks don't need to find the configuration for their particular database.
